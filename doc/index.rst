Mathematical Library for Critical Systems
==========================================

The LibmCS library has been developed by re-engineering the ``libm`` included in the ``Newlib`` library version 4.0.0. The work has been carried out under ESA Contract No. 4000130278/20/NL/AS.

The following pages in this documentation try to give a xenodochial introduction into LibmCS.
